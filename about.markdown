This is a personal blog of [Alex Ronver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-rovner/).
I write about things I learn about, mostly related to software development.
I blog mainly as a way to have a reference for myself, but I hope that some of the posts will be useful to others as well.
Another interest of mine is fitness and nutrition. I like exploring ways in which technology can be used to help people
with their fitness goals.
